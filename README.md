### Waste Not Want Not

Say goodbye to food waste and unnecessary spending with "WasteNot WantNot." This app will help you save money and reduce your environmental footprint by making smart and informed grocery decisions, all with just a few simple scans.

### Usage

First-time users: Before heading to the grocery store, simply scan everything that's left in your kitchen and the app will do the rest. "WasteNot WantNot" will learn from your past buying habits and consumption patterns to create personalized grocery plans based on what you currently have in your kitchen.

From then onward, simply scan your grocery receipts. By doing so, the app will automatically add those items to your inventory, making it easier for you to keep track of what you have on hand. All you need to do is remove the items from your inventory as you use them up, and the app will automatically update what's left in your kitchen.

### Core features:

- Virtual Inventory: Keep track of the items in your kitchen through a virtual inventory, making it easier for you to manage and keep track of what you have. You can handle and organize various inventories including those for your home, office, and business settings.
- Smart shopping lists: The app could suggest a shopping list based on the items in your inventory, your past buying habits, and consumption patterns.
- Food Waste tracking: Track the amount of food waste you generate and provide tips and suggestions for how to reduce it.
- Energy Waste tracking
- Expiration date suggestion + tracking: The app could track the expiration dates of the items in your inventory and send reminders when they are about to expire. (modified)
- Energy-efficient suggestions: The app can suggest energy-efficient alternatives for certain grocery items that require a lot of energy to store or cook, such as frozen dinners or pre-packaged meals. Additionally, the app could provide information on how to store and cook certain foods to minimize energy usage.
- Community sharing: The app could allow users to share their inventory with friends, family, or roommates. This would help avoid buying duplicate items and ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to what's in the kitchen.

### Additional features:

- Donation suggestions: The app could suggest nearby food banks or shelters to donate unused or unexpired food items. This would help users reduce food waste while also supporting their local community.
- Recipe suggestions: The app could suggest recipes based on the items in your inventory, making it easier to use up ingredients before they go bad.
- Nutrition tracking: The app could track the nutritional value of the food in your inventory and suggest recipes or meal plans that meet your dietary needs.
- Integration with grocery delivery services: The app could integrate with popular grocery delivery services (i.e. Instacart, Shipt) to make it easier for users to order the items they need.

### Inspirations

App name is inspired by an old proverb, which says "waste not, want not." It means that if you use your resources wisely and don't waste them, you will always have enough.

Inspiration struck me during my college years, as I found myself constantly sharing rooms with different students each year. One thing that we always seemed to struggle with was not having enough space in the fridge. As a result, I started to notice items that were left sitting there for months on end, many of which were obviously rotten. It was always a difficult situation when it came time to throw out these items, especially when I wasn't the owner. However, this experience gave me the inspiration to develop a solution to this common problem. I wanted to create an app or service that could help people better manage their fridge space, avoid wasting food, and make more informed decisions about what to buy and when to use it.
